    <h2>🌹 About Us – Les Fleurs d’Anthea</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>Les Fleurs d’Anthea</strong>, we believe flowers are more than just gifts—
      they are timeless messengers of love, joy, and comfort. What began as a simple dream
      to share beauty through blooms has blossomed into a flower shop known for elegance,
      artistry, and heartfelt service.
    </p>

    <p>
      From classic <strong>red roses</strong>, a symbol of passion and devotion,
      to vibrant sunflowers, graceful tulips, and delicate mixed arrangements, every bouquet
      we craft is designed to speak when words aren’t enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      We proudly partner with <strong>local farmers</strong> to showcase the best of our
      homegrown treasures, while also sourcing <strong>imported blooms from trusted international growers</strong>
      to bring the world’s finest flowers to your doorstep.
    </p>
	
    <p>
      Our promise is simple: <strong>freshness, beauty, and meaning in every bouquet.</strong>  
    Whether you’re celebrating life’s grand occasions or cherishing quiet moments,
    Les Fleurs d’Anthea is here to make them unforgettable.
  </p>
	
	<p> ✨<strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The name <em>Anthea</em> comes from the Greek word
    meaning <strong>“blossom.”</strong> It’s also the name of our beloved owner—a
    beautiful reminder that just like her name, our mission is to help life bloom
    with meaning and beauty.
